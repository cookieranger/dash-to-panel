This extension moves the dash into the gnome main panel (top or bottom bar) to behave as an icon-only task manager similar to that found in KDE Plasma and Windows 7+.\n\nIt is recommended to set Top Bar > Show Applications Menu off in Gnome Tweak Tool so that the application menu for native gnome apps will be presented within the application's window.",
